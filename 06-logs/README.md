# Phase 6 — Logs & Monitoring

This phase focuses on reading, filtering, and monitoring Linux system logs using Bash.

## Scripts

### 01-log-basics.sh
- Lists important log files
- Displays recent system logs

### 02-auth-log-monitor.sh
- Detects failed login attempts
- Useful for intrusion detection

### 03-error-summary.sh
- Summarizes recent system errors

## Why this matters
Logs are the first place security analysts and sysadmins look during incidents.
This phase builds real-world monitoring skills.

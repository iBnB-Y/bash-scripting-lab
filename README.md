## What is Bash scripting?

Bash scripting is writing commands in a file instead of typing them
one by one in the terminal.

If you can type a command in the shell,
you can put it in a Bash script.

The goal is simple:
do repetitive or boring Linux tasks automatically.


This repo is where I practice Bash scripting for real Linux work.

I use it to automate small tasks, understand how Linux behaves,
and build scripts I would actually run on a system.

This is not tutorial code.
Scripts here improve as I learn.

## Structure

Each folder represents a phase of learning.
I don’t rush phases and I don’t copy scripts I don’t understand.

## Notes

- Most scripts require sudo
- Tested on Ubuntu
- Written for learning, not production
